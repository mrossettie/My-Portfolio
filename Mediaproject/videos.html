  <p style= "font-size: 17px; text-align: center;">WARNING: There is some strong language used in this video, not a lot but thought id still put that out there.This is a video of a strange "young" man, almost wizard-like, who has taken upon himself to make pickle pepsi based off of KFC's limited time pickle pepsi drink (I honestly had no idea that was a thing before making this)</p>
